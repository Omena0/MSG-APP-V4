# MSG APP V4
 Oh, its another msg app?

It will be done really soon dont worry!!

## NEWS:
PLUGIN SUPPORT!!!
I have added plugin support OFFICALLY!
From this state forward this project is no longer in alpha, nor beta, but in ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT!

# Professional tutorial:

## The most important part: client!
### How do you use the client? How can i connect to servers? I will answer theese questions here!
### Step 1. Downloading.
Download or clone the repo.
Either clone or click on Code > Download zip
#### OR
Go to relases > Newest relase and download there
### Step 2.  Installing / building.
You can either use the newest build, or build the app yourself by running build.cmd.
First you need to get pyinstaller. Open command prompt (i reccomend windows terminal preview from microsoft store) and type
```python
pip install pyinstaller
```
then you should be able to run the build script. If it does not work still check that the script builds from the right path, since ive been swiching it alot.
Currently it is code/X/X.py X being either server, auth or client.
Then just open dist/ and run the client or server!
### Step 3. Usage.
#### To use the app you need an ACCOUNT!
To get an account, contribute and ask me on discord, then i might give you an account. Yes, i dont care what it is, reporting bugs, spelling mistakes somewhere, bad design AS LONG AS IT HELPS THE REPO, ill give u account. This is a way of rewarding contributors (hope i get some lmao)
#### Signing in with an account.
To sign in simply enter the username and password, thats it.... why did i make this? because ur stupid. (not everyone is stupid which makes u even more stupid, i know theres someone whos dumb in here)

## Server hosting tutorial:
#### First you need some expirience with python, since i am a human, i have bugs, you might find some, please make github issues!
### Step 1. Download repo. 
You can do this without a tutorial... If u cant u shouldnt be making a server..
### Step 2. Configure server. (optional but if u want it to be public)
#### To be honest in not here to make a tutorial on port forwarding, so see some tutorials on that.
After you have port forwarded port 5000 to your machine (or server?), Just make sure you can reach it. Then you need to contribute and message me on discord if u can give u a server key. Yes you need a key for having server discovery enabled (since people could flood the entire thing with profanity).
After that you can code some plugins if you want to expand your servers powers (without looking at my terrible code lmao)
The plugin system is simple, just view the example plugin in plugins/plugins.py.
I think you can do something with that but i still need to add more features.

#### Wait is that it?? Yes because i didint have to do tutorial on DOWNLOADING A REPO...

# Bye

## No, im not doing a tutorial on auth server, thats mine, and only mine!
